# Sad App Monorepo

This repository is a monorepo which contains 2 workspaces, one a `React` UI
library and the other a `React` App which _consumes_ the UI library.
Unfortunately, because the UI library depends on `react@^18` and the App depends
on `react@^16`, these two projects in their current state are incompatible with
each other â€” even worse, we don't find this out until runtime when a call to
`useId()` explodes in the `Button` [component](./packages/ui/src/Button.jsx) ðŸ˜¢

The only reason this incompatibility is possible is because we allow each of
these workspaces to declare their own dependencies in their respective
`package.json`, which is why this is the **Sad App Monorepo**.

There are a few ways to address this issue, each with its own tradeoffs, but the
way that I prefer is to only have **one** version of a given dependency for the
_entire_ monorepo.

To see my preferred method of resolving this issue in action, see
[the companion repository for the "Happy App Monorepo"](https://github.com/andrewbrey/blog-monorepo-deps-happy-app).
