    <p>
      If everything was working correctly, the page you're looking at
      <i>would</i> have a counter button (supplied by the workspace
      <b>ui</b> lib) rendered inside the dotted area!
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, there are errors caused by incompatibilities between the
      <b>ui</b> lib workspace and the <b>app</b> workspace which cause the app
      to fail to fully render (open up your browser console to see the error).
